# Nth_largest_unmber_with_tests

PHP function that would return the Nth largest element from start or the end (default from the end) in an array with a set of test cases against that function.

- Note: That is the Nth largest element in the sorted order, not the Nth distinct element.
For Example: Given [3,2,1,5,6,4], n = 2, from = end, return 5.
